# Description
## This pull request addresses the following issues and enhancements:

    Issue #123: Fixes a bug where XML validation fails for certain edge cases.
    Enhancement: Adds additional test coverage for XML validation scenarios.

## Changes Made

    Bug Fix: Resolves issue where XML validation incorrectly flagged well-formed XML strings as invalid due to handling of special characters.
        Updated validation logic to properly handle special characters within attribute values.
        Adjusted parsing to correctly interpret whitespace and character placements between tags.

    Enhancement: Expanded test suite to cover:
        Various edge cases such as nested tags with complex attributes.
        XML strings with mixed content and special characters.
        Ensured tests include scenarios for single and multiple root elements.

## Purpose

    Improvement: Ensure robustness and accuracy of XML validation across a wide range of use cases.
    Quality Assurance: Validate fixes against identified issues and ensure new functionality meets expected behavior.
    Documentation: Update test documentation to reflect new test scenarios and expected outcomes.

## Testing Approach

    Unit Tests: Introduced new unit tests using [testing framework] to validate XML parsing and validation functions.
    Integration Tests: Integrated tests into existing test suite to ensure compatibility and coverage across modules.
    Review: Inviting code review for validation logic and test implementation to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
